Which of the following is a requirement of the simple Metropolis algorithm?
(1)  The parameters must be discrete. <- No

(3)  The proposal distribution must be symmetric. <- Yes

## 8E2

Gibbs sampling is more efficient than the Metropolis algorithm. How does it achieve this extra efficiency? Are there any limitations to the Gibbs sampling strategy?
