In this case, it seems like the effects of water and shade also depend on temperature, and all three predictors may interact. While water and blooms have a generally positive relationship under cool temperatures, under hot temperatures this relationship is flat, and no matter how much water a plant recieves it will not produce more blooms. Same goes for shade, if the temperature is hot, then the plants could be in the light or the dark and still produce the same number of blooms (0). Knowing the temperature seems to be necessary if you want to predict how light and shade will affect bloom number.
