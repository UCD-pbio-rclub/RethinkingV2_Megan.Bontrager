### 4H1

**The weights listed below were recorded in the !Kung census, but heights were not recorded for these individuals. Provide predicted heights and 89% intervals (either HPDI or PI) for each of these individuals. That is, fill in the table below, using model-based predictions.**

| Individual | weight | expected height | 89% HDPI       |
|------------|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1          | 46.95  |           | |

| 4          | 32.59  |        |  |
| 5          | 54.63  |    |  |

```{r, error=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, cache=TRUE}
data(Howell1)

d = Howell1 %>% 
  filter(age >= 18) %>% 
  mutate(w = standardize(weight))

w_mean = mean(d$weight)
w_sd= sd(d$weight)

With brms:

```{r, error=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, cache=TRUE}
m4.1.2 <- brm(height ~ w, data = d,
               prior=c(
                 set_prior("normal(154, 20)", class = "Intercept"),
                 set_prior("lognormal(0,1)", class = "b", lb = 0),
                 set_prior("exponential(1)", class = "sigma"))
               )
summary(m4.1.2) 

predict(m4.1.2, newdata = data.frame(w = std_weights), summary = TRUE, probs = c(0.055, 0.945))

```

Parameter estimates are nearly identical. Predictions too.


<!-- ### 4H2 -->

<!-- **Select out all the rows in the Howell1 data with ages below 18 years of age. If you do it right, you should end up with a new data frame with 192 rows in it.** -->

<!-- **(a) Fit a linear regression to these data, using quap. Present and interpret the estimates. For every 10 units of increase in weight, how much taller does the model predict a child gets?** -->

<!-- For every 10 units increase in weight, the model predicts that a child gets 27.2 cm taller. -->


<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- juv = Howell1 %>% filter(age < 18) -->

<!-- xbar <- mean(juv$weight) -->

<!-- mod_juv = quap( -->
<!--   alist( -->
<!--     height ~ dnorm(mu, sigma), -->
<!--     mu <- a + b*(weight - xbar), -->
<!--     a ~ dnorm(178, 20), -->

<!-- precis(mod_juv) -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- **(b) Plot the raw data, with height on the vertical axis and weight on the horizontal axis. Super- impose the MAP regression line and 89% HPDI for the mean. Also superimpose the 89% HPDI for predicted heights.** -->

<!-- **(c) What aspects of the model fit concern you? Describe the kinds of assumptions you would change, if any, to improve the model. You donâ€™t have to write any new code. Just explain what the model appears to be doing a bad job of, and what you hypothesize would be a better model.** -->

<!-- The model is performing poorly at the low and high ends of the weight axis. It might be better to change the model to allow some curvature. -->
